Football Match Prediction using Machine Learning
Advanced Analytics for Match Outcome Forecasting
Abstract
This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting football match outcomes using multiple machine learning models. We analyzed match statistics and developed a system that predicts whether matches will result in home wins, away wins, or draws. The project implements Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to capture statistical patterns in match data. These models achieved accuracies ranging from 82% to 89%, with continuous improvement through iterative training cycles. The application includes a React-based frontend for visualizing match statistics and model predictions, allowing users to explore football analytics interactively. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining machine learning with real-time web interfaces for sports outcome forecasting.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Statement
Football match prediction is inherently challenging due to the sport's dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature. Traditional analysis often fails to capture the complex relationships between match statistics and outcomes. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging multiple machine learning approaches to predict match results.

1.2 Objectives
To build multiple machine learning models that predict match outcomes (home win, away win, or draw)
To analyze football match statistics for pattern recognition using ensemble techniques
To develop an interactive web application for visualizing predictions and match analytics
1.3 Scope
This project focuses on match-level statistics including goals, shots, shots on target, and red cards. The scope includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and frontend development for interactive use.

2. Dataset and Preprocessing
2.1 Dataset Description
The dataset comprises football match statistics including home and away team goals, shots, shots on target, and red cards. Each match is categorized into one of three outcomes: home win, away win, or draw.

2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized team performance metrics using radar charts
Analyzed the correlation between shot efficiency and match outcomes
Examined the impact of red cards on match results
2.3 Preprocessing Steps
Feature engineering including shot efficiency and goal-to-shot ratios
Normalization of input features for optimal model performance
Data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance
3. Methodology
3.1 Machine Learning Models Used
We implemented three distinct models to capture different aspects of the prediction problem:

Naive Bayes for probabilistic classification
Random Forest for ensemble decision tree analysis
Logistic Regression for linear boundary classification

Compare different modeling techniques on the same problem
Combine strengths of probabilistic, tree-based, and linear models
Provide more robust predictions through model averaging
